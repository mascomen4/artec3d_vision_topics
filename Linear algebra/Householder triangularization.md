In essense householder triangularization does the "orthogonal triangularization" using elementary reflectors named after American mathematician Householder.

- **Note:** Householder triangularization uses the householder reflectors which are represented in the form 
$$\begin{bmatrix}
-cos(\theta) & sin(\theta)\\
sin(\theta) & cos(\theta)
		\end{bmatrix}$$   and the Jacobi algorithm uses the rotation matrices: $$\begin{bmatrix}
cos(\theta) & -sin(\theta)\\
sin(\theta) & cost(\theta)
\end{bmatrix}$$
