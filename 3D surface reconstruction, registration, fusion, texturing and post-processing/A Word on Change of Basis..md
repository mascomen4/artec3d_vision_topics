Remember the change of basis formula: $$ P^{-1} M Q $$
- So, here, $Q$ controls "*from where*" the map will transform, and $P^{-1}$ controls "*to where*" the map will transform. Considering that $M$ represents a map $W \to V$. 
- $P$ is change of basis matrix for $V$
- $Q$ is change of basis matrix for W
So, the final transformation becomes now $Q \to P$

And in the case of endomorphism (mapping from itself to itself) it becomes: $$ P^{-1} A P $$
- If $A$ were a mapping $E \to E$, now it becomes a mapping $P \to P$
- Again, $P$ controls from where the map goes, and $P^{-1}$ controls to where the map goes.

- [ ] So, does it mean that the skew-symmetric matrix $[a]_{\times}$ is an endomorphism and a mapping from itself to itself?
